Admin (producer) must generate JSON that validates here.\n\nDECISIONS (LOCKED)\n  - Multiple campaigns are allowed; player resolves priority at runtime.\n  - Ordering is explicit via `order` (NOT array position).\n  - Duration is strict: durationSec >= 1 (0 is forbidden).\n  - Strict schema: additionalProperties is false (no silent/unknown fields).\n  - Comments are allowed via a `$comment` string field.\n\nSEMANTICS OVERVIEW\n  A config = a list of campaigns. Each campaign contains an ordered list of items.\n  The Player renders items in ascending `order` inside a campaign.\n  Campaigns are selected by priority at runtime.\n\nEVOLUTION RULES\n  Any change here must:\n    1) Update examples in shared/contract/examples/\n    2) Keep `make validate` passing\n    3) Be paired with player/admin changes if semantics change\n*/",
